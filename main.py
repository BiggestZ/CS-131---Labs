"""
Would your program work for the visitors in Part III? If not, why not? What assumptions did you make about the personal information of the visitors? What assumptions did you make about how this information would be entered?:


My Program would not work for the part 3 visitors. For the First Visitor, My program would 
fail at the phone number. I programmed the form to only take numbers that are a length of 10 numbers, 
the length of an American Phone Number without dashes. For the 2nd visitor, I did not consider if the 
user were to intentionally leave the boxes blank, or provide a website as input.
						 								
___________________________________________________________

How would you change your program so that it wouldnâ€™t fail? What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this? You do not have to actually make the changes, only describe what you would do.
	
I would have to change the phone number so that it can take more or less than 10 numbers. 
This can make my code less effective at validating the information by giving the user more control 
over their input. For the 2nd visitor, I would have to create a seperate field where people can enter 
other forms of data (website links, social media, etc) as well as make it so fields can be left 
intentionally blank.

___________________________________________________________ 								
Why might programmers care about these things? How might you approach these problems differently in the future? 


A programmer cares about these things because not accounting for these factors makes our code 
less accessible and therefore ineffective. 
There is no point in creating a form that people cannot use. I will use this lab as a lesson to 
consider when my constraints may be excessive or exclusive to particular groups.
